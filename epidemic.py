"""
Epidemic attributes and infection in the dynamical networks
The assumed attributions of virus, update network/society and the epidemic information, record the newest epidemic data.

Class - virus

Inputs / assumptions:
hidden_day - the incumbation period of virus.
coef_recovery, coef_death, coef_infected - the parameters of recovery, death and infection probability distribution.

variable:
hnum - # of healthy people in network.
pnum - # of patients.
rnum - # of recovery persons.
dnum - # of death persons.

Functions:
recovery_prob - recovery probability of patients follows as normal distribution, e.g., norm( 30, 15 ).pdf( x )*20, x is ill days.
death_prob - death probability of patients follows as inverse distribution, e.g., 1 / ( 51-x ).
infect_prob - infection probability of healthy people follows as log distribution, e.g., log10( n+1 ), n is # of sick neighbours.
explicit_prob - symptoms manifest probability which follows as linear distribution, e.g. x/14 because the incubation of COVID19 ss 14 days.
free - 0: isolation; 1: no isolation because no symptoms when surpass the incubation period.
*: the reason why utilize those distribution and the picture of those distributions are shown in the introduction.pdf.


Dynamical Network:
d1, d2 - the density of patients, the density of asymptomatic virus carriers.
crowd_num - the range of the number of crowds/clusters in network.
daynum - number of days.
density - the edge density in the secondary clusters / crowds, the larger, the denser.

Attributions / variables:
state - explicit state of persons, 0: healthy or sick; 0.5: recovery; >=1, sick.
real - real state of persons, 0: healthy; 0.5: recovery; >=1: sick ( the larger, the worse ).
loc - the secondary clusters / crowds in network.
touch_history - record touch history with hidden days of the node (person).
isolation - whether isolation of the node ( person ).
iso_day - the number of isolation days.
hos - whether in hospital or not of the node ( person ).
hos_order - the order of accessing in hospital.
color - the color of nodes, 'b': healthy people; 'r': symptomatical patients; 'y': asymptomatical virus carriers; 'g': recovery people.

Functions:
createNotes - create nodes and add the attributions to the nodes in the network.
createEdges - create edges in the networks and record the touch history list for each nodes (persons).
updataLinks - update links between nodes for each day.
updateInfected - update infected persons in the network for each day.

Output:
GUI - display the dynamical network / society (g).
Including the number of healthy people, recovery people, dead peoplein the environment for each day. Finally, get the number of days
to make no infected people.
